twitch tv api (php 5.3)
=================

Twitch tv API public method api url generator and client library.

**Ronaldo Barbachano (doinglines.com) Nov. 2012**

A polymorphic query generator defined by a single assoc. array '$twitch'. Assoc. elements with keys define 'sub functions' (function_subfunction).	With a few extra callouts on  specific methods that have different GET param's (search, search_games) or a differing url structure.

Extensive notes are contained in the library and 'examples.php'. Currently only public api methods are supported.
